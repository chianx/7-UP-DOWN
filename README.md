TeThis is a 7-UP-DOWN game silmulator made by using basic HTML CSS Javascript Node.js

To use the simulator locally, change directory to the project location and initialize node using ...

           (Search on internet about npm init if you have never used it before)
Install the required dependencies (express, body-parser) using ...
           >npm install
Run the server using ... 
           > node server.js 
           or > nodemon server.js (if you have nodemon installed)    
The server will start on localhost 3000
Open your browser and type url -- > http://localhost:3000/

Now you can access the Simulator and enjoy it .
